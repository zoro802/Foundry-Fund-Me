Foundry Fund Me Project

This repository contains the source code, scripts, and tests for the Foundry Fund Me projectâ€”a demonstration of deploying and interacting with a smart contract that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to fund and withdraw ETH. The project is built using Foundry and includes official Chainlink dependencies.

Requirements

    Git
    Verify installation by running:

git --version

You should see output similar to: git version x.x.x.

Foundry
Verify installation by running:

forge --version

Expected output: forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z) (version may vary).

Optional Tools:

    foundry-zksync (for local zkSync development)

    npm & npx
    Verify by running:

npm --version
npx --version

Docker
Verify installation by running:

        docker --version

Quickstart

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-fund-me-cu
cd foundry-fund-me-cu

Build the project by running:

    make

Optional Gitpod

If you prefer to work in Gitpod, open this repository in Gitpod and skip the clone step.

Usage
Deploy

To deploy the FundMe contract, run:

forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol

Deploy to a Testnet or Mainnet

Before deploying, set up your environment variables:

    PRIVATE_KEY: The private key of your account (use a development key, not one with real funds).

    SEPOLIA_RPC_URL: The RPC URL for the Sepolia testnet (obtain one for free from Alchemy or Infura).

    ETHERSCAN_API_KEY (Optional): For verifying your contract on Etherscan.

Then deploy using:

forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY

Testing

This project covers Unit Tests and Forked Tests.

    To run all tests:

forge test

To run a specific test matching a pattern:

forge test --match-test testFunctionName

To run tests on a forked network (e.g., Sepolia):

    forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL

Test Coverage

To get a detailed gas snapshot and test coverage report, run:

forge coverage

This will generate an output file (e.g., .gas-snapshot) showing gas usage and coverage metrics.
Local zkSync Deployment

If you want to deploy and test on a local zkSync node, follow these steps:

    Install foundry-zksync.

    Run:

npx zksync-cli dev config

and select: In memory node and do not select any additional modules.

Start the zkSync node:

npx zksync-cli dev start

You should see output similar to:

In memory node started v0.1.0-alpha.22:
 - zkSync Node (L2):
   - Chain ID: 260
   - RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8011
   - Rich accounts: https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/testing/era-test-node.html#use-pre-configured-rich-wallets

To deploy to the local zkSync node:

    make deploy-zk

Additional Information
Scripts

After deploying to a testnet or local network, you can interact with your contract using scripts:

    To fund the contract:

forge script script/Interactions.s.sol:FundFundMe --rpc-url sepolia --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast

To withdraw funds:

    forge script script/Interactions.s.sol:WithdrawFundMe --rpc-url sepolia --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast

Alternatively, using cast:

cast send <FUNDME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "fund()" --value 0.1ether --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
cast send <FUNDME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "withdraw()" --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>

Formatting

To format your code, run:

forge fmt

Chainlink Dependencies

This project uses the official Chainlink Brownie Contracts repository maintained by Chainlink.
Note: Chainlink contracts are published officially via npm. This repository wraps them for Foundry usage.
What is Foundry DevOps?

Foundry DevOps is a set of tools designed to streamline development workflows with Foundry. It helps with automation for deployments, testing, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.

To install Foundry DevOps, run:

forge install Cyfrin/foundry-devops --no-commit

If you encounter issues regarding embedded Git repositories, ensure your project is a Git repository and remove any unwanted embedded repositories using:

git rm --cached -r lib/chainlink-brownie-contracts
